Project Description:
  I recently purchased an asset pack that contained 32 animations with In Place and Root Motion.
  The Root Motion animations are great, but the root motion moves the character too far through the scene.
  I decided to create a simple script that would scale the root motion animation by a percentage without 
  having to hand adjust any keyframes.

Project Usage:
1) Import the root animation into the scene
2) Select the root motion
3) import the script
4) run: ScaleZ.TranslateZ(0.5); // input 0.0-2.0
