WEEK 02 Assignment 


Name the four Maya programming interfaces.
  (I'm not sure what you mean by 4, the only 3 I can tell are C++, Py, MEL, 
	but the book says Maya Command Engine is one if I read it correctly.)
	- C++
	- Python
	- MEL
	- Maya Command Engine

What are the three ways to run Python in Maya?
	- Command Line
	- Shelf
	- Script Editor
	
What version of Python is being used in your version of Maya?
	- 2.7.11 (default, Dec 21 2015, 22:48:54) [MSC v.1700 64 bit (AMD64)]
	import sys;
	print(sys.version);

If you run this code:
	test_variable = “12345” 
a. What type of variable is the_answer?
	String
b. What Python command can you run to confirm this?
	type()
	
Most Maya commands have these three modes: create, query, and edit. Explain what each means.
	- Create: Create mode lets you create new objects in the scene, 
		you dont have to do anything special to execute commands in create mode.
	- Query: Query lets you gain information about an object. 
		You must specify a command argument first then set query flag to True.	
	- Edit: Edit lets you change information about an object. 
		You must specify a command argument first then set edit flag to True.
