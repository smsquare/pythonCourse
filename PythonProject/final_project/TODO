#TODO: Create a set of tools / module for auto adjusting the root motion distance.
#	 The goal of these tools is to provide them with an animation that can then
#	 be adjusted based off of a scalar that is passed in.
#	 This will adjust the distance traveled / value of the keyframe itself
#	 without actually changing the timing of the keyframe itself.
